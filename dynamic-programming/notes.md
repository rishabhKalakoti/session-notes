### Geeks for Geeks

1) Identify if it is a DP problem

2) Decide a state expression with least parameters

3) Formulate state relationship

4) Do tabulation (or add memoization)


### Optimization & Combinatorial problems
An optimization problem is a problem of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions. And combinatorial problems expect you to figure out the number of ways to do something or the probability of some event happening.

### Examples
0-1 knapsack
Matrix Chain Multiplication
LCS
